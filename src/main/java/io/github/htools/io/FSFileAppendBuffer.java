/**
 * This class is intended to remove all the Java fuzz regarding files. There is
 * just one class FSFile that provides methods to read a line, read the entire
 * thing, write stuff to it, without having bother about which stream to use.
 * However, Java objects like properly opened FileInputStream and FileChannel.
 * <br><br> Some methods are provided that will more easily allow to get
 * information on the file, such as the parent Dir object, the filename,
 * extension, etc. <br><br> Some static methods are provided to do big file
 * operations, such as copying, moving, running and converting a File to a
 * primitive.
