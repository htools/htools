 * Indicates an attempt was made to read past End Of Content, in which to Content

 * that the ceiling for a file or buffer was reached. For support of file handling
 * across regular filing system, HDFS, and compressed files, one has to realize that
 * EOF is not always predictable, therefore reading must often be continued until
 * EOC is reached. Therefore EOC is rarely a fatal Exception, but merely an indication 
 * that reading is done.
 * <p>
 * The Exception must be caught when not fatal, otherwise it will be propagated up
 * end end up as a fatal Exception (i.e. if encountering EOC is fatal, don't catch and
 * you get just that).
